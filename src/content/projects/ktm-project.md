# KTM Web Page

This project is based on the design concept inspired by the official KTM website, using HTML5 and CSS3 as main technologies. It presents a minimalist and modern interface. The page consists of a hero where a presentation is shown to the user and a gallery of minimalist cards that display the different motorcycles. Additionally, it includes a footer with relevant information and contact details.

## Project Create With HTML5 (Semantic) & CSS3 (BEM)

In this project, I make use of HTML5 technologies by applying solid semantics to provide a robust structure to the web page. In addition, I use CSS3 with the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for stylization through classes, ensuring a visual design consistent and maintainable.

## Characteristics

* Minimalist and modern design inspired by the official KTM website.
* Use of HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and style of the website.
* Hero section for an initial presentation.
* Card gallery showing different motorcycle models.
* Footer with relevant information and contact details.
